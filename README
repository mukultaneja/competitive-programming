Competitive Programming

This repository is to share programming problems code publicly. I am active on multiple competetive programming portals such as HackerEarth/LeetCode/CodeChef and have a keen interest to solve problems over there. 

So I will be sharing my code for the problems which I could solve on these portals. Any one can contribute in the problem code if he/ she can make it better in terms of performance and others can take these problem codes as an reference or practise.
